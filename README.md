# R code for finding activity sensitive spectral lines

Stellar activity including spots and plages may lead to false discoveries or poor mass estimates for small exoplanets when using radial velocity (RV) techniques. In this file, we provide the R code for a recently proposed method to identifying activity sensitive spectral linesa -- using a Bayesian variable selection approach to fast and automatically  search  for  activity-sensitive lines. 

The code file contains the functions for the Bayesian variable selection algorithm. The "main.R" is the main function. The "example.R" provides an example on how to use the "main.R" function using the data from alpha Centrauri B. Since the data size is large, we are unable to upload it in this folder. If interested, please send us a request to us (Bo Ning: bo.ning@yale.edu or Alexander Wise: aww@udel.edu), we would like to provide a copy.
